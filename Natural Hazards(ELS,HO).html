<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    Natural Hazard Natural hazards are potentially damaging natural phenomena that may occur within specific period of time in a given area that may cause danger to people, structures or economic c assets and which may lead t o a disaster.
    A widely accepted definition characterizes natural hazards as "those elements of the physical environment, harmful to man and caused by forces extraneous to him.
    "More specifically, in this document, the term "natural hazard" refers to all atmospheric, hydrologic, geologic (especially seismic and volcanic), and wildfire phenomena that, because of their location, severity, and frequency, have the potential to affect humans, their structures, or their activities adversely. 

</p>
<p> 
    The qualifier "natural" eliminates such exclusively manmade phenomena as war, pollution, and chemical contamination. Hazards to human beings not necessarily related to the physical environment, 
    such as infectious disease, are also excluded from consideration here. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodynaturalhazards_container_textarea_Mitigation" id="Mitigation">
<h2>Mitigations</h2>
<p>
    Hazard mitigation describes actions taken to help reduce or eliminate long-term risks caused by hazards or disasters, such as flooding, 
    earthquakes, wildfires, landslides, or dam failure. 
    As the costs of disasters continue to rise, governments and citizens must find ways to reduce hazard risks to our communities
</p>
<p>
    As communities plan for new development and improvements to existing infrastructure, mitigation can and should be an important component of the planning effort. 
</p>
<h3>Three phases of Mitigation</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Preparedness and Mitigation(what to do before)</p></li>
    <li><p>Response (what to do during) </p></li>
    <li><p>Rehabilitation </p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Types of Mitigation Techniques</h3>
<h4>Prevention</h4>
<p>
    Government, administrative, or regulatory actions that influence the 
    way land and buildings are developed to reduce hazard losses. Includes planning and zoning, 
    floodplain laws, capital improvement programs, open space preservation, and stormwater management regulations.
</p>
<h4>Property Protection </h4>
<p>
    Modification of buildings or structures to protect them from a hazard or removal of structures from a hazard area. I
    ncludes acquisition, elevation, relocation, structural retrofit, storm shutters, and shatter-resistant glass.
</p>
<h4>Public Education and Awareness </h4>
<p>
    Actions to inform citizens and elected officials about hazards and ways to mitigate them. Includes outreach projects, 
    real estate disclosure, hazard information centers, and school-age and adult education. 
</p>
<h4>Natural Resource Protection </h4>
<p>
    Actions that minimize hazard loss and preserve or restore the functions of natural systems. Includes sediment and 
    erosion control, stream corridor restoration, watershed management, forest and vegetation management, and wetland 
    restoration and preservation.
</p>
<h4>Emergency Services</h4>
<p>
    Actions that protect people and property during and immediately after a hazard event. 
    Includes warning systems, emergency response services, and the protection of essential facilities.
</p>
<h4>Structural Projects </h4>
<p>
    Actions that involve the construction of structures to reduce the impact of a hazard. Includes dams, setback levees, 
    floodwalls, retaining walls, and safe rooms.

<h2>Geological Hazards</h2>
<p>
    Geologic hazards phenomena can occur suddenly, or slowly. Sudden phenomena include:
</p>
<h3>Earthquakes</h3>
<p>
    An earthquake is a shaking of the ground caused by sudden slippage of rock masses below or at the surface of the earth. - 
    It is a wave-like movement o f the earthâ€™s surface.
</p>
<h3>Tsunami</h3>
<p>
    Tsunamis are giant sea waves generated by under-the sea earthquakes and volcanicer uptions. 
    Not all submarine earthquakes , however, can cause the occurrence of tsunamis.
</p>
<h3>Landslides</h3>
<p>
    A landslide is a massive outward and downward movement of slope-forming materials. 
    The term landslide is restricted to movements of rocks and soil masses. 
    These masses may range in size from card to entire mountainsides.
    Their movements may vary in velocities.
</p>
<h3>Volcanic Eruption</h3>
<p>
    a process wherein volcanic materials such as molten o r hot fragmented rocks or gaseous materials are ejected from a volcano. 
    Hazards from volcanoes may be of different nature. 
    These hazards include flowing of fast-moving molten rocks and other ejected
</p>

<div class="bodynaturalhazards_container_textarea_PreparednessandMitigation" id="PreparednessandMitigations">
<h2>Preparedness and Mitigation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Conduct school advocacy on tsunami awareness, preparedness and mitigation. Regular tsunami drills should be conducted</p></li>
    <li><p>Turn on your radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning if an earthquake occurs and yo u are in a coastal area. </p></li>
    <li><p>Assign a focal person to monitor and observe the water recession after an earthquake.</p></li>
</ul>
