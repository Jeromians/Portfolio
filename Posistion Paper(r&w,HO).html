<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    A position paper (sometimes position piece for brief items) is an essay that presents an arguable opinion about an issue – typically that of the author or some specified entity. 
    Position papers are published in academia, in politics, in law and other domains. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that the opinion presented is valid and worth listening to. 
    Ideas for position papers that one is considering need to be carefully examined when choosing a topic, developing an argument, and organizing the paper.
</p>
<p> 
    Position papers range from the simplest format of a letter to the editor, through to the most complex in the form of an academic position paper.
    Position papers are also used by large organizations to make public the official beliefs and recommendations of the group.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyposistionpaper_container_textarea_Purposeofthepaper" id="Purposeofthepaper">
<h2>Purpose of the paper</h2>
<p>
    To argue your position on an issue raised in at least two of the articles we have read, showing how your position relates to those of the authors.
    Position papers in academia enable discussion on emerging topics without the experimentation and original research normally present in an academic paper. 
    Commonly, such a document will substantiate the opinions or positions put forward with evidences from an extensive objective discussion of the topic.
</p>
<p>
    An academic audience that includes the authors of the readings and others interested in the issue upon which you are focusing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyposistionpaper_container_textarea_compositionofposistionpaper" id="compositionofposistionpaper">
<h2>Composition of Posistion of Paper</h2>
<p>
    You may (or may not) be asked to include a thesis at the beginning and references at the end of your position paper. 
    However, these three essential parts must always be there: introduction, body, and conclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The paper is mainly written by the delegates of a country in a conference to show their position in a specific matter. 
    The main goal is usually to reason logically and compellingly, hence convincing the audience that your policy is both valid and defensible.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The introductory part can make the reader or audience either dismissive or interested to know more. Begin with a few opening sentences
             that capture their attention. You also want to use suspense so that your reader is hooked. Most importantly, however, the introduction 
             paragraph should inform your reader about the issue you have chosen.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Body</h3>
        <p>
            The body of a position paper has three parts: background information, evidence to support your opinion, 
            and a discussion of both sides of the matter. You need to conduct thorough research and have enough facts to back up your claims. 
            However, don’t forget to address both sides of the argument.
        </p>
        <p>
            It shows the reader that you were not biased in your considerations and, ultimately, gives you a better shot at convincing them. 
            Of course, the arguments supporting your position should be more than counterarguments. Also, remember to mention the idea before 
            the evidence to back it up and then go on to explain that evidence.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            A good conclusion provides a summary of your key points and lets the audience in a conference know where you stand. 
            You can restate your thesis at the beginning of the conclusion, then go on to summarise the key points. Your stand 
            must always come out clearly before you wrap up. What’s more, you must suggest the way forward at the end.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="bodyposistionpaper_container_textarea_Aspectofposistionpaper" id="Aspects">
<h2>Aspects of Posistion Paper</h2>
<p>
    Writers of position papers usually feel strongly about the issues they address, and they strive to
convince readers to accept their opinions as valid and reasonable. To achieve this end, position
papers typically include the following features: a well-defined, controversial issue; a clear position
on the issue; a convincing argument; and a reasonable tone. Furthermore, position papers will often
attempt to make use of emotional appeals as well as intellectual appeals to sway an audience.
</p>
<h3>Well-defined and Conteversial Issue</h3>
<p>
    Although the issue addressed in the position
paper may be complex, it should be carefully defined so that readers understand exactly what is at
stake and why the issue is important. Moreover, the issue must not be only controversial but also
arguable. Some issues upon which there is considerable debate are not arguable because they can
either be.
</p>
<h3>Clear Posistion on the Issue</h3>
<p>
    A position paper makes explicit the opinion it advocates
by announcing it directly in a thesis statement, which may appear at any point in the essay. In long,
complicated essays, the thesis may even be restated several times. Although it should be stated
emphatically, the thesis can be modified in the course of the argument.
</p>
<h3>Convincing argument</h3>
<p>
    In debating controversial issues, writers naturally assume that their
    readers will either disagree with them or be skeptical. Because they seek to build bridges between
    their own opinions and those of others, writers of position papers typically adopt a tone that will be
    perceived as reasonable and trustworthy. Even when challenging their reader’s basic assumptions
    about deeply felt issues, writers try to inspire respect and confidence

<h2>Strategies on Writing an Posistion paper</h2>
<p>
    Now, knowing the parts that your essay should have is not enough when you have to write an attractive 
    and convincing position paper. You should have a few other tricks up your sleeve to guide you in terms 
    of selecting a topic, developing the argument, conducting research, etc.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>Focus</h3>
        <p>
            on a narrowly defined issue found in at least two of the readings. Use a specific, 
            clearly stated thesis to introduce the focus. Introduce the issue early in the discussion.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Develop</h3>
        <p>
            your argument by defending your claim and showing how it relates to the positions of your sources. 
            Show the positions of three authors, at least two of which must be from the list below of class readings. 
            You must refer to all class readings that address the issue upon which you focus. Use clearly 
            stated reasons and relevant, effective evidence. Reasons should represent sound logic. Evidence may be drawn from the readings, 
            personal experience, and outside sources such as interviews, surveys, or written sources.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Organize</h3>
        <p>
            your paper in a way that effectively conveys information to your readers, is easy to follow, 
            and presents your position in relation to those of the authors.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Style</h3>
        <p>
            Write in a style that is clear, readable, appropriate to audience, and free from distracting errors in spelling, 
            grammar, and usage.
        </p>
