            Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. 
            It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. 
            Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive,

            the said field.
            Psychology borders on various other fields including physiology, neuroscience, sociology, anthropology, 
            as well as philosophy and other components of the humanities. The history of psychology as a scholarly 
            study of the mind and behavior dates back to the Ancient Greeks. There is also evidence of psychological 
            thought in ancient Egypt. A high level of work on mind-sciences can be found in Vedic scriptures of Sanatana Dharm (Hinduism),

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <h6>January 18 2021</h6>
        <p>
            Family is the most basic unit of a community.The Filipino family provides an interesting study because familism is embedded in its social
            sphere, translating its relational quality outside the family. Being family-centred, child-centric,
            having close ties, and a large family size (Medina, 2001; Miralao, 1994) are some basic elements of
            families in the Philippines. Applying regression on the data from the World Values Survey for the
            Philippines in 1996 and 2001, this study aims to explore the correlates of views on family values
            among Filipinos, specifically those concerning the traditional nuclear family set-up, the woman's
            roles within family, and the reciprocal relationship of the parent and child. While the results
            show that Filipinos generally share family values, especially on those related to child rearing for
            both parents, and child-bearing, there are indications that such views also differ across educational attainment, 
            geographic location, social class, and ethnic groups. Disparities in views could
            be reflecting shifting family values, which could then help explain current polarising policy
            debates on issues on the reproductive health, divorce, and migration.......

          <h6>January 7 2021</h6>
          <p>
              A position paper (sometimes position piece for brief items) is an essay that presents an arguable opinion about an issue
              typically that of the author or some specified entity. Position papers are published in academia, in politics, in law and other domains. 
              The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that the opinion presented is valid and worth listening to. Ideas for position 
              papers that one is considering need to be carefully examined when choosing a topic, developing an argument, and organizing the paper.
              Position papers range from the simplest format of a letter to the editor, through to the most complex in the form of an academic position paper.
              Position papers are also used by large organizations to make public the official beliefs and recommendations of the group.

          How did life begin? There can hardly be a bigger question. 
          For much of human history, almost everyone believed some version of "the gods did it". 
          Any other explanation was inconceivable.

          Life on Earth began more than 3 billion years ago, evolving from the most

          But how did the first organisms on the only known home to life in the universe develop from the primordial soup?
