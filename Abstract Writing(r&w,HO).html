<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    An abstract is a 150- to 250-word paragraph that provides readers with a quick overview of your essay or report and its organization. 
    It should express your thesis (or central idea) and your key points; it should also suggest any implications or applications of the 
    research you discuss in the paper.
</p>
<p> 
    According to <b>Carole Slade</b>, an abstract is <i>“a concise summary of the entire paper.”</i>
</p>

</div>
<div class="bodyabstractwriting_container_textarea_WhatisAbstractWriting" id="WhatisAbstractWriting">
<h2>What is Abstract Writing?</h2>
<p>
    The abstract allows you to elaborate upon each major aspect of the paper and helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper. 
    Therefore, enough key information [e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.] must be included to make the abstract useful to someone 
    who may want to examine your work.
</p>
<p>These are some qualities that must be included in your <b>"Abstract Paper"</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>The function of an abstract is to describe, not to evaluate or defend, the paper.</li>
    <li>The abstract should begin with a brief but precise statement of the problem or issue, 
        followed by a description of the research method and design, the major findings, 
        and the conclusions reached.</li>
    <li>The abstract should contain the most important key words referring to method and content:<br> 
        these facilitate access to the abstract by computer search and enable a reader to 
        decide whether to read the entire dissertation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your abstract should read like an overview of your paper, not a proposal for what you intended to study or accomplish. 
    Avoid beginning your sentences with phrases like, “This essay will examine...” or “In this research paper I will attempt to prove...”
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyabstractwriting_container_textarea_WhentowriteAbstract" id="WhentowriteAbstract">
<h2>When to write an Abstract?</h2>
<p>
    You will almost always have to include an abstract when writing a thesis, dissertation, 
    research paper, or submitting an article to an academic journal. In all cases, the abstract 
    is the very last thing you write. It should be a completely independent, self-contained text, 
    not an excerpt copied from your paper or dissertation. An abstract should be fully understandable 
    on its own to someone who hasn’t read your full paper or related sources.</p>
<p>   
    The easiest approach to writing an abstract is to imitate the structure of the larger work—think of it as a miniature 
    version of your dissertation or research paper. In most cases, this means the abstract should contain four key elements.
</p>
<h3>Aims</h3>
<p>
Start by clearly defining the purpose of your research. What practical or theoretical problem does the research respond to, or what research question did you aim to answer?
You can include some brief context on the social or academic relevance of your topic, but don’t go into detailed background information.
After identifying the problem, state the objective of your research. Use verbs like investigate, test, analyze  or evaluate to describe exactly what you set out to do.
</p>
<p>
    This part of the abstract can be written in the present or past simple tense, but should never refer to the future, as the research is already complete.
</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>
    Next, indicate the research methods that you used to answer your question. This part should be a straightforward description of what you did in one or two sentences. 
    It is usually written in the past simple tense as it refers to completed actions.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t evaluate validity or obstacles here—the goal is not to give an account of the methodology’s strengths and weaknesses, but to give the reader a quick insight 
    into the overall approach and procedures you used.
</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
    Next, summarize the main research results. This part of the abstract can be in the present or past simple tense.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on how long and complex your research is, you may not be able to include all results here. 
    Try to highlight only the most important findings that will allow the reader to understand your conclusions.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Finally, state the main conclusions of your research: what is your answer to the problem or question? The reader should finish with a clear understanding of the central 
    point that your research has proved or argued. Conclusions are usually written in the present simple tense
</p>
<p>
    If there are important limitations to your research (for example, related to your sample size or methods), you should mention them briefly in the abstract. 
    This allows the reader to accurately assess the credibility and generalizability of your research.
</p>
<p>
    If your aim was to solve a practical problem, the conclusions might include recommendations for implementation. 
    If relevant, you can briefly make suggestions for further research.
</p>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>
If your paper will be published, you might have to add a list of keywords at the end of the abstract. 
These keywords should reference the most important elements of the research to help potential readers 
find your paper during their own literature searches.
</p>
<p>
Be aware that some publication manuals, such as APA Style, have specific formatting requirements for these keywords.
</p>

<div class="bodyabstractwriting_container_textarea_tips" id="Tips">
<h2>Tips for writing an Abstract</h2>
<p>
    It can be a real challenge to condense your whole dissertation into just a couple of hundred words, 
    but the abstract will be the first (and sometimes only) part that people read, so it’s 
    important to get it right. These strategies can help you get started.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Reverse outline</h4>
        <p>
            Not all abstracts will contain precisely the same elements. 
            If your research has a different structure 
            (for example, a humanities dissertation that builds an argument through thematic chapters), 
            you can write your abstract through a process of reverse outlining.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Read other abstracts</h4>
        <p>
            The best way to learn the conventions of writing an abstract in your discipline is to read other people’s. 
            You probably already read lots of journal article abstracts while conducting your literature review—try 
            using them as a framework for structure and style.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Write clearly and concisely</h4>
        <p>
            A good abstract is short but impactful, so make sure every word counts. Each sentence should clearly communicate one main point.
            Avoid unnecessary filler words, and avoid obscure jargon—the abstract 
            should be understandable to readers who are not familiar with your topic.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Focus on your own research</h4>
        <p>
            The purpose of the abstract is to report the original contributions of your research, so avoid discussion of others’ work, 
            even if you address it at length in the main text.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might include a sentence or two summarizing the scholarly background to situate your research and show its relevance to a broader debate, 
            but there’s no need to mention specific publications. Don’t include citations in an abstract unless absolutely necessary 
            (for example, if your research responds directly to another study or revolves around one key theorist).
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Check your formatting</h4>
        <p>
            If you are writing a thesis or dissertation or submitting to a journal, there are often specific formatting requirements for the abstract—make sure to check the guidelines and format your work correctly. For APA research papers you can follow the APA abstract format.
            Always stick to the word limit. If you have not been given any guidelines on the length of the abstract, write no more than one double-spaced page.
