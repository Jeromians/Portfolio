<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    An article is a written work published in a print or electronic medium. 
    It may be for the purpose of propagating news, research results, academic analysis, or debate. 
    The main motive behind writing an article is that it should be published in either newspapers or magazines or 
    journals so as to make some difference to the world. It may be the topics of interest of the writer or it may 
    be related to some current issues. The topic can either be serious or not-so-serious; Same goes for its tone and language
</p>
<p> 
    An article is potentially the most efficient means for disseminating your research and establishing a publication record; 
    many areas of academic life such as finding employment and winning research grants depend on a good publication record. 
    Online journals have increased the geographical spread for academic work, reinforcing the importance of articles in creating 
    and furthering your research reputation.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyarticle_container_textarea_Whattowrite" id="Whattowrite">
<h2>What to write?</h2>
<p>
    The content and structure of your article is determined by the topic you select and the potential reading audience. 
    You are proffering your contribution to the academic field, keeping in mind what is already being discussed by others. 
    Your article will add to the academic discourse in a particular field. Therefore, choose a journal that best reflects your potential readership.
</p>
<p>
    In considering how suitable your article is for publication, the editors will consider various factors, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Originality of the ideas</h4>
        <p>
            article needs to be novel, based on your own ideas and research, and add to current scholarly knowledge.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Significance of the Ideas</h4>
        <p>Novelty is not sufficient if there is no purpose or significance in relation to current scholarly writing. 
            Does your work fill a gap in the current discourse? Does it offer new methods or ways of reconceptualising theory? 
            Does it challenge current assumptions? Your article needs to fulfill its own unique role within a discipline’s scholarly discourse.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Quality of the writing</h4>
        <p>
            Your article needs to be written in an academic style, according to what is standard for your discipline. 
            it helps if it is also interesting and engaging. Scholarly writing is not necessarily boring.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is also important to consider the style guide. You do not want to upset the editors by ignoring their requirements; 
    after all, they determine whether your work is worth publishing. Check the journal’s website for information regarding fonts, spacing, 
    margins and referencing styles.
</p>
<p>
    Ensure you allow plenty of time for writing your article. You should expect to write several drafts as you refine your thoughts. Remember, 
    you will be writing for an unknown readership which will have some expertise, but not necessarily specific knowledge of your topic.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyarticle_container_textarea_objective" id="objective">
<h2>Objective of an Article</h2>
<p>
    An article is written with the following objectives: It brings out the topics or the matter of interest in the limelight,
    It offers suggestions and pieces of advice,The article discusses various stories, persons, locations, rising-issues, and technical developments,
    The article provides information on the topics, It influences the readers and urges them to think
</p>
<p>
    With so many objectives of an article, it is quite predictable that the presentation must be unique in order to achieve the utmost success. 
    Different writers portray their ideas and in their own writing styles, but there is an overall guideline that is maintained by all. 
    An article must start with an engaging heading or title so that readers immediately dive into the body. An abstract must be added 
    immediately after the heading to let people know what they are going to read about and how the content is helpful to them. 
    Make it short and precise so that the entire topic is captured on a quick note. Following the synopsis comes the body of the article 
    that consists of 3 to 4 paragraphs.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyarticle_container_textarea_articlecritique" id="articlecritique">
<h2>Artice Critique</h2>
<p>
    An article critique is an assignment that requires a student to critically read a research article and reflect upon it. The key task is 
    to identify the strong and weak sides of the piece and assess how well the author interprets its sources. Simply put, a critique reflects 
    upon the validity and effectiveness of the arguments the article’s author used in his or her work.
</p>
<p>
    The key to success in writing this paper is critical thinking. The task of every author of a research article is to convince readers of the 
    correctness of his or her viewpoint, even if it is skewed. Thus, the only ways to distinguish solid arguments from weak ones are to be a 
    good researcher, have the right tools to pick out facts from fiction, and possess solid critical thinking skills.    
</p>
<p>
    First of all, to critique the article, you need to read it carefully. For a better outcome, it is recommended to read the piece several 
    times—until you fully understand the information presented in it. when you have an idea about which way you should be heading in your 
    critique paper, it is the time to start gathering evidence. Just like any other written assignment, a critique paper should be formatted 
    and structured properly. A standard article critique consists of four parts: an introduction, summary, critique, and conclusion.

    <h1>Activity:</h1>
    <h5>Activity 1:</h5>
    <p>Give an article review of this Article. Both Stories are True:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><p>“Sometimes people have trouble simultaneously holding both of these insights. 
        There is a tendency to discuss outcomes in either a global sense or a local sense. 
        The absolute view is more global. What explains the difference between a wealthy person born i
        n America and someone born into extreme poverty and living on less than $1 per day? When discussing s
        uccess from this angle, people say things like, “How can you not see your privilege? Don’t you realize 
        how much has been handed to you?” The relative view is more local.”</p></li>
    
    <li><p>What explains the difference in results between you and everyone who went to the same school or
        grew up in the same neighborhood or worked for the same company? When considering success from a local viewpoint,
         people say things like, “Are you kidding me? Do you know hard I worked? Do you understand the choices and 
         sacrifices I made that others didn’t? Dismissing my success as luck devalues the hard work, I put in. 
         If my success is due to luck or my environment, then how come my neighbors or classmates or coworkers 
         didn’t achieve the same thing?”.</li></p>
