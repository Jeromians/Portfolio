<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    In human society, family (from Latin word familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity 
    (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship). The purpose of families is to maintain 
    the well-being of its members and of society. Ideally, families would offer predictability, structure, and safety as 
    members mature and participate in the community. In most societies, it is within families that children acquire 
    socialization for life outside the family, and acts as the primary source of attachment, nurturing, and socialization 
    for humans. Additionally, as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members, it provides a sense of 
    boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment, ideally builds a person into a functional adult, transmits culture, 
    and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge.

<div class="bodyfamily_container_textarea_FilipinoforFamily" id="FilipinoforFamily">
<h2>Family for Filipinos</h2>
<p>
    Family is the most basic unit of a community.The Filipino family provides an interesting study because familism is 
    embedded in its social sphere, translating its relational quality outside the family. Being family-centred, child-centric, 
    having close ties, and a large family size (Medina, 2001; Miralao, 1994) are some basic elements of families in the Philippines. 
    Applying regression on the data from the World Values Survey for the Philippines in 1996 and 2001, this study aims to explore the 
    correlates of views on family values among Filipinos, specifically those concerning the traditional nuclear family set-up, the woman's
    roles within family, and the reciprocal relationship of the parent and child.
    
</p>
<p>
    While the results show that Filipinos generally share family values, especially on those related to child rearing for both parents, 
    and child-bearing, there are indications that such views also differ across educational attainment, geographic location, social class, 
    and ethnic groups. Disparities in views could be reflecting shifting family values, which could then help explain current polarising policy 
    debates on issues on the reproductive health, divorce, and migration.......
</p>

<div class="bodyfamily_container_textarea_typeoffamily" id="TypeofFamily">
<h2>Type of families</h2>
<p>
    Family ties are very strong in the Philippines and traditionally greater emphasis has been put on the family than individuals. 
    Families have traditionally been bound together by loyalty, respect and affection. Family members are expected to follow rules 
    set by the head of the household rather than pursuing their own individual agenda. 
</p>
<p>
    Children grow up in many different structures of families, and, at different times in their
    lives, their family structure may change. For young children, the family in which they live is the
    “normal” family. It is when children enter group programs outside of their homes that they
    discover that there are many kinds of families and that the important adults in those programs
    may or may not think of the child’s family as “normal” or acceptable.
</p>
<p>
    One of the most important tasks for early childhood educators is to treat each child’s
    family with respect and help each child feel proud and strong about their family. especially in this modern society
    ther is so many kind of family that doesn't even follow basic format format. In filipinism norms and Modern norms about 
    family is very different and huge discussion but for now we need to know what are kind of family out there and make our
    future generation more open minded than today.
</p>
<h3>Nuclear family</h3>
<p>A family consisting of a married man & woman
    and their biological children. 
</p>
<p>
    This family form is the one most reinforced in the dominant in filipino society. 
    The main issue for children is to help them understand that their two-parent, heterosexual family is a fine
    family, and is one kind among many other kinds of families.
    It is essential that early childhood teachers do not assume that just because a family has a nuclear structure, 
    they do not need support and connection. 
</p>
<h3>Extended family</h3>
<p>
    A family where Grandparents or Aunts and
    Uncles play major roles in the children’s upbringing. This may or
    may not include those relatives living with the children. These
    family members may be in addition to the child’s parents or instead
    of the child’s parents
</p>
<h3>“Broken home” or Broken Families</h3>
<p>
    A highly derogatory term used to describe the homes of children from divorced
    families. Very hurtful.
</p>
<h3>Co-custody family</h3>
<p>
    An arrangement where divorced parents both have legal responsibility for
    their children. Children may alternatively live with both parents or live with one and have regular
    visitation with the other. 
</p>
<h3>Single parent family</h3>
<p>
    This can be either a father or a mother
    who is singly responsible for the raising of a child. The child can
    be by birth or adoption. They may be a single parent by choice
    or by life circumstances. The other parent may have been part
    of the family at one time or not at all
</p>
<h3>Blended families</h3>
<p>
    A family that consists of members from two (or more) previous families. this also a end product 
    of unions of single parent and broken families that are not related.
    Be clear that all family members are “real” and that all the relationships are important to the child.
</p>
<h3>Adoptive family</h3>
<p>A family where one or more of the children has been adopted. Any
    structure of family may also be an adoptive family.
    Sometimes children (as well as adults) use the term” real parents” instead of “birth
    parents”. Be clear that the adoptive parents are the real parents because they are
    raising the child
</p>
<h3>Foster family</h3>
<p>
    A family where one or more of the children is legally a temporary member of the
household. This “temporary” period may be as short as a few days or as long as the child’s entire
childhood. Kinship care families are foster families where there is a legal arrangement for the
child to be cared for by relatives of one of the parents. 
</p>
<h3>Bi-racial or multi-racial family and Trans-racial adoptive family </h3>
<p>
    A family where the parents are members of different racial identity groups; A family where the adopted child is
    of a different racial identity group than the parents.

<div class="bodyfamily_container_textarea_conclusion" id="Conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Family is not a standard for you in order to be included in a society also, being families now a days doesn't need to have a standard in order recognize as one.
        families especially in our society, build up our beliefs and also our norms which we apply in our society now-adays. they are also the bastion for us to be bound into a community
        without families there will be no community to be formed. it is very intergral part from every individual up to community aspect. Peoples can't live alone they have someones or groups
        which even they are not blood related they still considerd them as families. especially in moderns days families is may vary in diffferent aspect but still have one reason and it is to support and love each other
