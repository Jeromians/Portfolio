<h2>Introduction</h2>

    resounding afffect within the said field. Psychology borders on various other fields 
    including physiology, neuroscience, sociology, anthropology, as well as philosophy and other 
    components of the humanities. The history of psychology as a scholarly study of the mind and 
    behavior dates back to the Ancient Greeks. There is also evidence of psychological thought in 
    ancient Egypt. A high level of work on mind-sciences can be found in Vedic scriptures of Sanatana Dharm (Hinduism),

<div class="bodyAspectofSelf_container_textarea_Earlypsychologicalthought" id="Earlypsychologicalthought">
<h2>Early psychological thought</h2>
<p>
    Ancient Greek philosophers, from Thales (fl. 550 BC) through even to the Roman period, developed an \
    elaborate theory of what they termed the psuchẽ (psyche) (from which the first half of "psychology" is derived), 
    as well as other "psychological" terms – nous, thumos, logistikon, etc.The most influential of these are 
    the accounts of Plato (especially in the Republic),Pythagoras and of Aristotle (esp. Peri Psyches, 
    better known under its Latin title, De Anima).Plato's tripartite theory of the soul, Chariot Allegory 
    and concepts such as eros defined the subsequent Western Philosophy views of the psyche and anticipated modern psychological proposals, 
    such as Freud's id, ego and super-ego and libido; to the point that "in 1920, Freud decided to present Plato as the precursor of his own theory, 
    as part of a strategy directed to define the scientific and cultural collocation of psychoanalysis".[13] Hellenistic philosophers 
    (viz., the Stoics and Epicurians) diverged from the Classical Greek tradition in several important ways, especially in their 
    concern with questions of the physiological basis of the mind.The Roman physician Galen addressed these issues most elaborately and 
    influentially of all. The Greek tradition influenced some Christian and Islamic thought on the topic.
