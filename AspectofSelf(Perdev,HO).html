<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    There is so many people has contributed in field of psychology and it make a 
    resounding afffect within the said field. Psychology borders on various other fields 
    including physiology, neuroscience, sociology, anthropology, as well as philosophy and other 
    components of the humanities. The history of psychology as a scholarly study of the mind and 
    behavior dates back to the Ancient Greeks. There is also evidence of psychological thought in 
    ancient Egypt. A high level of work on mind-sciences can be found in Vedic scriptures of Sanatana Dharm (Hinduism), 
    an application of certain principles as a part of yogic practices of India
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodyAspectofSelf_container_textarea_Earlypsychologicalthought" id="Earlypsychologicalthought">
<h2>Early psychological thought</h2>
<p>
    Ancient Greek philosophers, from Thales (fl. 550 BC) through even to the Roman period, developed an
    elaborate theory of what they termed the psuchẽ (psyche) (from which the first half of "psychology" is derived), 
    as well as other "psychological" terms – nous, thumos, logistikon, etc.The most influential of these are 
    the accounts of Plato (especially in the Republic),Pythagoras and of Aristotle (esp. Peri Psyches, 
    better known under its Latin title, De Anima).
</p>    
<p>   
   Plato's tripartite theory of the soul, Chariot Allegory 
    and concepts such as eros defined the subsequent Western Philosophy views of the psyche and anticipated modern psychological proposals, 
    such as Freud's id, ego and super-ego and libido; to the point that "in 1920, Freud decided to present Plato as the precursor of his own theory, 
    as part of a strategy directed to define the scientific and cultural collocation of psychoanalysis".[13] Hellenistic philosophers 
    (viz., the Stoics and Epicurians) diverged from the Classical Greek tradition in several important ways, especially in their 
    concern with questions of the physiological basis of the mind.The Roman physician Galen addressed these issues most elaborately and 
    influentially of all. The Greek tradition influenced some Christian and Islamic thought on the topic.

<h2>Person Of Psychology</h2>
<p>
    Psychology is the study of the mind. Men and women have grappled for centuries to unlock the 
    mysteries within ourselves. This challenge has demanded the attention of history’s greatest thinkers.
</p>
<p>
    We owe much of what we understand about ourselves to the brilliant minds that came before us. 
    The history of psychology is populated with genius, and no shortage of eccentricity, they are psychologists 
    that helped lay the groundwork for our understanding of the human mind, mental health, and mental disorder, 
    as well as those who helped to shape the education and profession surrounding psychology..

<h3>Socrates</h3>
<p>
    Socrates seems to have often said that his wisdom was limited to an awareness of his own ignorance. 
    Socrates may have believed that wrongdoing was a consequence of ignorance, that those who did wrong 
    knew no better. 
</p>
<p>
    The one thing Socrates consistently claimed to have knowledge of was "the art of love" 
    which he connected with the concept of "the love of wisdom", i.e., philosophy. He never actually claimed 
    to be wise, only to understand the path that a lover of wisdom must take in pursuing it. It is debatable 
    whether Socrates believed that humans (as opposed to gods like Apollo) could actually become wise. 
</p>
<p>
    On the one hand, 
    he drew a clear line between human ignorance and ideal knowledge; on the other, Plato's Symposium (Diotima's Speech) 
    and Republic (Allegory of the Cave) describe a method for ascending to wisdom

<h3>Plato</h3>
<p>
    Plato proposed that the human psyche was the seat of all knowledge and that the human mind was imprinted with all of the 
    knowledge it needed. As a result, learning was a matter of unlocking and utilizing this inbuilt knowledge, a process he called anamnesis.
    In his famous work, 'The Republic,' Plato further developed this idea and first proposed the idea that the mind consisted of three interwoven parts, called the Tripartite Mind.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>The Logistikon</h3>
        <p>This was the intellect, the seat of reasoning and logic</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Thumos</h3>
        <p>his was the spiritual centre of the mind, and dictated emotions and feelings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>The Epithumetikon</h3>
        <p>This part governed desires and appetites.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    According to Plato, the healthy mind discovered a balance between the three parts, 
    and an over reliance upon these parts led to the expression of personality. 
    For example, gluttony and selfishness could be explained by a dominance of the Epithumetikon, letting desires govern behavior

<h3>Aristotle</h3>
<p>
    Aristotle, building upon the work of the earlier philosophers and their studies into mind, reasoning and thought, 
    wrote the first known text in the history of psychology, called Para Psyche, 'About the Mind.' In this landmark work, 
    he laid out the first tenets of the study of reasoning that would determine the direction of the history of psychology; 
    many of his proposals continue to influence modern psychologists.
</p>
<p>
    In the book, the definition of psyche, as was common at the time, used 'mind' and 'soul' interchangeably, 
    with the Ancient Greek philosophers feeling no need to make no distinction between the two. 
</p>
<p>
    In Para Psyche, Aristotle's psychology proposed that the mind was the 'first entelechy,' or 
    primary reason for the existence and functioning of the body. This line of thought was heavily 
    influenced by Aristotle's zoology, where he proposed that there were three types of souls defining life; 
    the plant soul, the animal soul and the human soul, which gave humanity the unique ability to reason and create. I
    nterestingly, this human soul was the ultimate link with the divine and Aristotle believed that mind and reason 
    could exist independently of the body.

<h3>Rene Descartes</h3>
<p>
    Rene Descartes (1596-1650) was a French philosopher and mathematician. Considered the 
    "father of modern philosophy" Descartes developed many ideas that lead to the creation of many modern fields of study. 
    As a mathematician he developed concepts that linked algebra and geometry which eventually led to the evolution of calculus.
</p>
<p>
    In psychology Descartes is most known for his concept of dualism. Descartes' theory of dualism suggests that there are two realms to existence. 
    The first is the physical realm which is the environment and the things around us. This is the "realm of matter and energy". 
    This realm can be researched and is scientific because it operates in a prescribed "mechanical" way. The other realm is mental and is
    "transcendent" to the physical environment and cannot be measured.
</p>
<p>
    Dualism allowed for the separation of sciences and the non-physical realm, which was important long ago because it allowed scientists 
    to conduct their research without fear of being considered heretics by religious groups. Dualism creates a problem for psychologists and the study of the mind: 
    psychologists can ignore the mind entirely and view behavior as purely mechanical or include the mind in study but it not be considered "scientific".

<h3>Gilbert Ryle</h3>
<p>
    Through this work, Ryle is thought to have accomplished two major tasks. First, he was seen to have put the final nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism. 
    Second, as he himself anticipated, he is thought to have argued on behalf of, and suggested as dualism's replacement, the doctrine known as philosophical 
    (and sometimes analytical) behaviourism. Sometimes known as an “ordinary language”, sometimes as an “analytic” philosopher, Ryle—even when mentioned in the same 
    breath as Wittgenstein and his followers—is considered to be on a different, somewhat idiosyncratic (and difficult to characterise), philosophical track.
</p>
<p>
    Ryle analogizes philosophy to cartography. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker: 
    the ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and geography. But when asked to interpret a map of that 
    knowledge, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographic terms. The villager thinks 
    of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographic terms.
</p>
<p>
    By "mapping" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls implication threads: each word or phrase of a statement 
    contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions 
    and limits of different implication threads that a "concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs." To show this, he must be "tugging" at neighbouring threads, 
    which, in turn, must also be "tugging." Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.

    <h3>Emmanuel Kant</h3>
    <p>
        Immanuel Kant was one of the greatest philosophers of all time, and had more 
        influence on other renounced thinkers than any other philosopher of the 18th century. 
        He was inspired by his study of Hume's writings, especially Hume's psychological analysis of causality. 
        One of his greatest contributions to philosophy was the merging of rationalism and empiricism.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kant argued that the mind brings to experience certain qualities of its own that order it. 
        These are the twelve a priori [deductive] categories of causality, unity, totality, and the like, 
        and the a priori intuitions of time and space. While the mind has no substance, it is an active process 
        that serves to convert raw sensory data into meaningful, ordered experiences. Kant names the process apperception. 
        Things in themselves cannot be known, we perceive the world only the way our mind makes us do it, i.e., through the 
        instrumentality of the innate mental categories. Kant thus accepted the notion of mental facilities--cognition, 
        feeling, desire understanding, judgement, and reason. . . .

     <h3>David Humes</h3>
    <p>
        Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and Berkeley, favoured the bundle theory of personal identity.
        In this theory, "the mind itself, far from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions' 
        without unity or cohesive quality".The self is nothing but a bundle of experiences linked by the relations
        of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea
        of such a bundle. According to Hume
    </p>
    <p>
        This view is supported by, for example, positivist interpreters, who have seen Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", 
        "person", or "mind" refer to collections of "sense-contents". A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has 
        been advanced by Derek Parfit in his Reasons and Persons.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct 
        selves can have perceptions that stand in relation to similarity and causality. Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled 
        into distinct "bundles" before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity and causality. In other words, 
        the mind must already possess a unity that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone. S

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
       Psychology is been flourish through years and really cultivated by our beloved scholars, all thier statement might be true or false but one thing is certain
       that is human si build up with different aspect to be called self. humanity is very interesting species of life. for some reason we are the only life on Earth
       to questions what we are? why we are? and How we are?, as mentioned earlier many scholar is curios enough to question how our consciousness works and how does 
       somrthing to be consisdered to be called self. Many in this belief simplified that self is build up of two or more aspect just like soul and the material being or 
       bodies. For me all these belief is reasonable and very well said, they also presented thier evidence for supporting their beleif to be true
       but one thing is certain.
