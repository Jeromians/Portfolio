<h2>Introduction</h2>    
<p>
    Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. 
    Stress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline
    Stress is the body's reaction to any change that requires an adjustment or response. The body reacts to these changes with physical, mental, and emotional responses. 
    Stress is a normal part of life. You can experience stress from your environment, your body, and your thoughts. Even positive life changes such as a promotion, 
    a mortgage, or the birth of a child produce stress.
</p>
<p> 
    Simply a reaction to a stimulus that disturbs our physical or mental equilibriums. In other words, its an omnipresent part of life
    A stressfull event can trigger the "Fight-orFlight" reposnse ,causeing hormones such as adrenaline and cortisols to surge through the body.
    It is also a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It may come from any events or througth that make you feel frustrated, angry,nervous.
</p>
</div>
<div class="bodystress_container_textarea_typeofstress" id="TypeofStress">
<h2>Type of Stress</h2>
<p>
    According to American Psychological Association (APA), there are 3 different types stress — acute stress, episodic acute stress, and chronic stress. 
    The 3 types of stress each have their own characteristics, symptoms, duration, and treatment approaches.
    Stress management can be complicated because each of the 3 different types of stress can present as single, repeated, complicated, or chronic. Therefore, 
    they require different levels of treatment interventions, management, and psychological treatment modalities due to the nature of the person’s environment, 
    lifestyle, developmental history, coping resources, and personality.
</p>
<h3>Acute Stress</h3>
<p>
    You know the feeling when you’re behind on a seemingly all-important deadline and then you get a call from your child’s school asking you to come by or 
    you barely miss a serious car accident. Your heart might race and your blood pressure might rise. Your sense of emergency might trigger a migraine or even 
    chest pain.
</p>
<p>
    Other possible symptoms include irritability, anxiety, sadness, headaches, back pain, and gut problems. These may appear for a short time and subside when the stress eases.
    Our minds extend acute stress. A recent argument may replay in your mind, keeping you up at night. Or you might keep worrying about the future, a deadline ahead. 
    You might benefit from learning techniques to calm your mind, but stress isn’t interfering with your relationships or career.
</p>
<h3>Episodic acute stress</h3>
<p>
    Some people experience these mini-crises regularly and live in a state of tension. They may be taking on too much or simply be overburdened by their lives. If you tend to
    worry, your body will be tense or angry. 
</p>
<p>
    The symptoms are similar but occur more often and accumulate.
    Maybe your company is poorly managed and your boss is stressed out, passing along emergencies to you. Those tight deadlines keep cropping up.
    In modern life, we often can’t take big, immediate actions to solve our problems. Instead, we can take small steps that build up over time.
</p>
<p>
    You might need to spend more time getting physical exercise while rethinking your finances in case you need to quit. You might need the help of 
    a therapist to change your circumstances or your responses to them.
</p>
<p>
    Over time, a pattern of episodic acute stress can wear away at your relationships and work. 
    That risk is greater if you turn to unhealthy coping strategies like binge drinking, overeating, or clinging to bad relationships. Many people also 
    slowly give up pursuing pleasurable activities or meaningful goals.   
</p>
<p>
    If poorly managed, episodic acute stress can contribute to serious illnesses like heart disease or clinical depression. 
</p>
<h3>Chronic stress</h3>
<p>
    This is the grinding stress that wears us down over the years. It arises from serious life problems that may be fundamentally beyond our control: poverty, war, or racism.
    The demands are unrelenting and you don’t know when they will stop. You get by day by day.
    If you had a traumatic childhood, you may experience life as chronically stressful even when the surface appears okay. You believe you are perpetually threatened 
    by poverty or illness even when this is untrue. Whether the cause lies in your mindset or difficult circumstances, many people stop fighting for change and begin to accommodate chronic stress. 
    It is important to get all the help you can and not blame yourself — blame will only grind you down further. Chronic stress feeds chronic and acute serious illness.
</p>
<p>
    Chronic stress can wear down the body's natural defenses, leading to a variety of physical symptoms, including the following:
</p>
<ul class="container">
    <li>Dizziness or a general feeling of "being out of it"</li>
    <li>General aches and pains</li>
    <li>Grinding teeth, clenched jaw</li>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Indigestion or acid reflux symptoms</li>
    <li>Muscle tension in neck, face or shoulders</li>
    <li>Problems sleeping</li>
    <li>Racing heart</li>
    <li>Cold and sweaty palms.</li>
    <li>Tiredness, exhaustion.</li>
    <li>Trembling/shaking.</li>
    <li>Weight gain or loss</li>
    <li>Upset stomach, diarrhea.</li>
    <li>Sexual difficulties.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Type of Stressor (Uestress Vs. Distress)</h2>
<p>
    In daily life, we often use the term "stress" to describe negative situations. This leads many people to believe that all stress is bad for you, 
    which is not true.
</p>
<h3>Eustress</h3>
<p>
    Positive stress, has the following characteristics: Motivates, focouses energy, Is perceived as within our coping abilities, Feels exciting,
	Improves perfomance, is also short-term event.
</p>
<h3>Distress</h3>
<p>
   In contrast, Distress, or negative stress, has the following: Causes anxiety or concern, Can be short- or long-term, Is perceived as outside of our coping abilities,
   Feels unpleasant, Decreases performance, Can lead to mental and physical problems.
